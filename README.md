# Auto ML

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS**

An R Package that can understand the data, print the summary statistics, plot the relevant plots and recommend actions 
on the data based on statistical analyses. The package is envisaged to do the following:

Auto EDA

 - [x] Univariate analysis and multivariate analysis
    - Summary stats, Histogram, density and box plots, Normality test score and outlier score, Spearman and Pearson correlations with features themselves and with target, heatmaps etc.
    - Bar plot/Count plot for different levels, Entropy gain for a level of categorical, Heat map with correlations of continuous features, etc.
 - [ ] Outlier detection and recommendation to treat them based on statistical analysis
 - [ ] Class imbalance detection and recommendation to treat them based on statistical analysis
 - [ ] Categorical Features â€“ Recommendation to group the levels if there are more number of levels and with lesser records, Recommendation for the best possible encoding (e.g. one-hot encoding, target encoding etc.)
 - [ ] Provide recommendation for the best possible feature transformation (e.g. log, sqrt, if power transform what power etc.)
